# Hello-World
my first repository

Here's a little bit about myself. I'm Nathan, I don't know what I'm doing.. all the time. That's all because my mother says and my father doesn't really know the difference. I Start and Stop all the time. But the story goes, I was in the Marine's and I tried to quit smoking. What I was willing to do to quit got me in big trouble. I got pretty loud..oh well. Sorry, but I've been on medications (like drugs) ever since. It's really lame. So, that's a little about me!
